# ARPKiller
ARPKiller is a tool developed in Python3 whose function is to disconnect one or more devices from the internet in a local network. To achieve this, it poisons the ARP traffic to make the victim's machine believe that your device is the gateway, thereby ensuring that the victim's network traffic never reaches the internet.
